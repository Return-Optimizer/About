### By purchasing our product you agree to our terms and conditions, read before you buy and do not buy if you do not agree.

1. You will not receive your money back if you request a refund or open a Paypal case. Why? Our software applies optimizations on the customer's computer, if we would allow refunds then customers would be able to apply the optimizations and then refund the money. This would be a fraud since they would get their money back while still enjoying the product.

2. Our product can only be used by one person. Thanks to our whitelist system using UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) you will only be able to use the software on a single device in order to prevent product sharing. We may remove your access to the software if we discover that you have tried to share it with another person.

3. We can remove your access to the software if we want. Don't worry, this will only happen if you perform any serious act at the level of disrespect, attempt to deobfuscate/decrypt the software or any other reason that the staff considers inappropriate.

These terms are subject to change __without notice__.
